2018 Quarterback Comparisons
---

A simple visualization of game statistics (specifically completion percentage) of NFL quarterbacks from the 2018 season. 

## Persona

This project is built to be used by fans or media looking to track and report trends in quarterback efficiency, as well as specific game performances.

## Visualization Formats

* Line charts for time series data (completion % and yards per attempt)
    - displayed separately to avoid confusion

* Tables for game logs

## Potential Areas for Future Improvement

* A chart comparing the performance of all three QBs at the same time.
* Change the size of the team logos in the completion percentage and yards per attempt charts based on number of attempts.
* Interactions that connect table and data (EX: hovering over a specific point on the chart highlights this row in the table)

## Technologies Involved

Node.js -- Express backend + EJS frontend
